# GameOfLife_Methuselahs

In Conway's Game of Life there are cellular automaton structures called methuselahs, which are simple pentomino block arrangements that seed intricate and long-lived structures. Methuselahs are self-contained examples of how complex structures can arise from very simple initial rules.

My take on the study of Game of Life methuselahs involves the addition of a logarithimic colormap to track their path or fingerprint of spread. Colormap intensity is a proxy for the age of a given ellular automaton at that particular location.

The first example is the well-known Glider, which is a simple spaceship-like pentomino that, once constructed, travels outwards diagonally towards infinity.

The second example is the R-Pentomino methuselah, the first discovered, and the structure that gave rise to the first observed Glider.

The third example is the Acorn methuselah, which is remarkably long-lived and generates many gliders despite its simple initial construction.
